# custom-spotify-tile-sharptools
This is a modification of the Spotify tile for sharptools

What I have changed:

- Album art covers entire tile ( applied darkened filter and slight blur to improve lists readability) when playing song / device is selected.

- When not playing / device is not selected elements stay transparent, song & artist section becomes hidden.

- Moved the song & tittle to the left

- Centered control buttons

- Applied transparency to elements background ( artist/song, player controls / lists )

Works great in smaller tiles (3*3) or mega tile.
